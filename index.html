			<h2 id="mon"><a href="htmldocs/Mondstadt.html" class="title">Mondstadt Sceneries</a></h2>
			<p class="quote">"A city of freedom that lies in the northeast of Teyvat.
				From amongst mountains and wide-open plains, carefree breezes carry the scent of dandelions 
				— a gift from the Anemo God, Barbatos — across Cider Lake to Mondstadt, which sits on an island 
				in the middle of the lake." - Genshin Impact </p>
			<p>Mondstadt is one of the seven regions in Teyvat and is the first nation to be visited by the Traveler. 
				It is known as the City of Freedom wherein the Anemo archon, Barbatos, rules the land. Dandelions, wine,
				Windwheel asters, Cecilia, Wolfberries, and Valberries are some of the local specialties in Mondstadt.

			<h2 id="li"><a href="htmldocs/Liyue.html" class="title">Liyue Sceneries</a></h2>
			<p class="quote">"A bountiful harbor that lies in the east of Teyvat. Mountains stand tall and proud alongside the stoneforest, 
				that, together with the open plains and lively rivers, make up Liyue's bountiful landscape, which shows its unique 
				beauty through each of the four seasons. Just how many gifts from the Geo God lie in wait amongst the rocks of Liyue's 
				mountains?" - Genshin Impact</p>
			<p>Liyue is one of the seven regions in Teyvat and is the second nation to be discovered by the Traveler.
				People there worships the Geo archon, Morax, and the nation is known as the City of Contracts. Liyue is also known

			<p class="quote">"An Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat Overcome endless thunderstorms and set foot on the islands of red 	maple and cherry blossoms. On winding shores and towering cliffs, and in forests and mountains full of secrets, witness 
				the Eternity pursued by Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho." - Genshin Impact</p>
			<p>Far from the lands of Mondstadt and Liyue lies the land of Inazuma. It is one of the seven regions in Teyvat and is
				the third nation to be discovered by the Traveler. Raiden Shogun, the current Electro Archon, governs the archipelago,
